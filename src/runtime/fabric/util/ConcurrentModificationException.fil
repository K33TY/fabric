/**
 * Exception that is thrown by the collections classes when it is detected that
 * a modification has been made to a data structure when this is not allowed,
 * such as when a collection is structurally modified while an Iterator is
 * operating over it. In cases where this can be detected, a
 * ConcurrentModificationException will be thrown. An Iterator that detects
 * this condition is referred to as fail-fast. Notice that this can occur
 * even in single-threaded designs, if you call methods out of order.
