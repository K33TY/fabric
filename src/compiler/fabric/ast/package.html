AST nodes for the Fabric language extension, along with all of the node,
extension, and delegate factories.

<h2>Extension Factory Classes</h2>
<p>There are a number of factory classes associated with building the extension
objects.  As documented in
<a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/andru/papers/polyglot.pdf">the CC'03 Polyglot paper</a>,
there should be a separate extension object for each language extension.  In the
case of Fabric (which is an extension of Jif), a properly constructed fabric
node should look as follows: <center><img src="doc-files/extobjects.png"/></center>
The node itself will be created by a {@link fabric.ast.FabricNodeFactory_c} object, and the
delegate will be created by a {@link fabric.ast.FabricDelFactory_c} object, but the
extension class factories are a little more complicated.
</p>

<p>All of the extension factories implement the {@link fabric.ast.FabricExtFactory}
interface, even those that produce <code>Jif</code> extensions rather than
<code>FabricExt</code> extensions.  The <code>FabricExtFactory</code>
interface simply designates a factory that is able to create extensions for all
of the fabric AST nodes.</p>

<p>The {@link fabric.ast.FabricJifExtFactory_c} class is responsible for creating all of
the <code>Jif</code> extensions in the diagram above.  It is a simple extension
of the <code>JifExtFactory_c</code> that is able to construct <code>Jif</code>
extensions for atomic sections (and any other new AST nodes we may add).</p>

<p>The {@link fabric.ast.AbstractFabExtFactory_c} class is a skeleton
implementation of the <code>FabricExtFactory</code> interface that takes care of
chaining extension objects together (much like the
<code>polyglot.ast.AbstractExtFactory_c</code> and the
<code>jif.ast.AbstractJifExtFactory_c</code> classes).  It delegates the actual
creation of the extension objects to <code>extFooImpl()</code> methods, which by
default simply call the parent factory methods.</p>

<p>Finally, the {@link fabric.ast.FabricFabExtFactory_c} class creates all of
the <code>FabricExt</code> classes in the above diagram.  It extends the
<code>AbstractFabExtFactory_c</code> class and overrides some of the
<code>extFooImpl</code> methods to create the actual extension objects used by
fabric.</p>

<p>Here is a diagram showing how it all fits together:
