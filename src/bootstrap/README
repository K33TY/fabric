This directory contains skeletons of classes that are implemented in Fabric but
are required to compile the parts of the system that is implemented in Java.

Since they are necessary for bootstrapping, these skeletons are
source-controlled.  However, with a working fabric compiler, most can be
automatically generated using the "-bootstrap-skel" compiler flag.
