Fabric (with State Warranties)
==============================
This is a branched release of Fabric that includes state warranties, as
described in our paper "Warranties for Faster Strong Consistency",
published in NSDI 2014 [1].

Fabric is a language and runtime system that supports secure federated
distributed computing. This is a quick-start manual to get you started
running some Fabric examples. A more detailed manual can be found in
the doc/manual directory of this distribution, or on the web at
<http://www.cs.cornell.edu/projects/fabric/manual/@VERSION@/html/>.

More information about Fabric, including the latest release, can be
found at the Fabric website <http://www.cs.cornell.edu/projects/fabric/>.
