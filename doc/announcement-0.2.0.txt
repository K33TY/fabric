We are pleased to announce the release of version 0.2.0 of the Fabric language
and system for secure federated computing. The new version of Fabric has many
substantial improvements over the original release, including:

    * Support for securely publishing and using mobile code, as described in our
      Oakland 2012 paper. Other new features accompanying mobile code include:

	- Access labels, which control covert read channels.
        - Provider labels, which prevent mobile code from causing damage.
	- Codebases, a new language feature supporting code and data evolution.

    * Fabric nodes are now easier to set up and to control. Worker nodes now
      have a console for convenient control over the node. This can be used to run
      Fabric programs and to invoke the Fabric compiler. Scripting of worker
      commands is also supported.

    * The new version comes with several new examples of Fabric applications,
      including web applications and applications that use mobile code.

    * Many improvements have been made to the performance and reliability of
      Fabric.
