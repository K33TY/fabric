# This is an example client configuration file.
# Copy this file to ${HOSTNAME}.properties and edit that file.


# File in ${FABRIC_HOME}/etc/keys that holds the client's private key store.
# This is optional.  By default, this is <client name>.keystore.
#
# Create the private key store with:
#   ${FABRIC_HOME}/bin/genkey <client name>

#fabric.client.keystore = client.name.example.keystore



# The oid for the client's principal object.
#
# The following command will create a new principal object on the given core
# and print out the object's oid.
#
#   ${FABRIC_HOME}/fab --make-principal <core name>
#
# When creating a principal object, this configuration parameter is optional;
# however, if one is given, it must either point to a valid principal object,
# or to an unallocated oid.
#
# A client principal oid must be supplied here before using the client for
# anything besides principal-object creation.

#fabric.client.principal = fab://core.name.example/19



# The port on which to listen for remote-call requests. This is optional.
# This is only needed if you're running the client on the same machine as a
# core (e.g., for testing purposes).
#
# The default value is 3373. If a different value is supplied here, it must
# match what is configured in fabric.client.NameService.clientPorts.

#fabric.client.port = 3374
