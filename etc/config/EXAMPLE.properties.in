# File in ${FABRIC_HOME}/etc/keys that holds the node's private key store.

# The oid for the worker's principal object.

# The following command will create a new principal object on the given store

# When creating a principal object, this configuration parameter is optional;
# however, if one is given, it must either point to a valid principal object,
