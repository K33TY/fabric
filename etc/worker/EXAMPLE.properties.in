# This is an example worker configuration file.
# Copy this file to ${HOSTNAME}.properties and edit that file.


# File in ${FABRIC_HOME}/etc/keys that holds the worker's private key store.
# This is optional.  By default, this is <worker name>.keystore.
#
# Create the private key store with:
#   ${FABRIC_HOME}/bin/genkey <worker name>

#fabric.worker.keystore = worker.name.example.keystore



# The oid for the worker's principal object.
#
# The following command will create a new principal object on the given store
# and print out the object's oid.
#
#   ${FABRIC_HOME}/fab --make-principal <store name>
#
# When creating a principal object, this configuration parameter is optional;
# however, if one is given, it must either point to a valid principal object,
# or to an unallocated oid.
#
# A worker principal oid must be supplied here before using the worker for
# anything besides principal-object creation.

#fabric.worker.principal = fab://store.name.example/19



# The port on which to listen for remote-call requests. This is optional.
# This is only needed if you're running the worker on the same machine as a
# store (e.g., for testing purposes).
#
# The default value is 3373. If a different value is supplied here, it must
# match what is configured in fabric.worker.NameService.workerPorts.

#fabric.worker.port = 3374
