# Fabric configuration properties.

# Base directory of Jif installation.
#
#   Will override the value defined in environment variable $JIF.
#   Must be an absolute path.
#   
#   If you are using the copy of Jif included in the Fabric
#   distribution, set this to the base directory of your Fabric
#   installation.

jif.home=${env.HOME}/jif


# Base directory of Polyglot installation.
#
#   Will override the value defined in environment variable $POLYGLOT.
#   Must be an absolute path.
#   
#   If you are using the copy of Polyglot included in the Fabric
#   distribution, set this to the base directory of your Fabric
#   installation.

polyglot.home=${env.HOME}/polyglot


# JDK installation directory.
#
#   This is ordinarily picked up from config.properties in Jif's source
#   tree, but you will need to set this here if you are only building
#   against Jif binaries (e.g., if you are using the copy of Jif
#   included in the Fabric distribution).

#jdk.home=${java.home}

#   The following may work better if you have the JAVA_HOME environment
#   variable defined:

#jdk.home=${env.JAVA_HOME}
