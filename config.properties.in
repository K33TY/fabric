# Fabric configuration properties.


# JDK installation directory
#
# This is optional. If not set, then the following values are used, in
# order of precedence:
#
#   1. The jdk.home property from config.properties in Jif's source
#      tree.
#
#   2. The JAVA_HOME environment variable.
#
# The commented example below uses Ant's built-in java.home property,
# which on some systems points to the JRE, and not the JDK.

#jdk.home=${java.home}


# Jif installation directory
#
# This is optional. By default, the copy of Jif included in the Fabric
# distribution is used.

#jif.home=${env.HOME}/jif


# Polyglot installation directory
#
# This is optional. By default, the copy of Polyglot included in the
# Fabric distribution is used.

#polyglot.home=${env.HOME}/polyglot
