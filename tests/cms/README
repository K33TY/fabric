This test is a port of cms to fabric.  It is organized as follows:

1. The pojo directory contains a ``port'' of the edu.cornell.csuglab.cms.base
   package and the corresponding dao objects and generated code.  This basically
   removes all persistence and just models the database as a collection of java
   objects

2. The fabric directory is a copy of the pojo directory, with the pojo's
   converted to fabric objects, atomic sections added, and other appropriate
   changes.

3. The common directory contains the common configuration, front-end interface,
   and so on.  The intent is that this stuff will work with either
   implementation (fabric or pojo).
