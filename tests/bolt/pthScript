#      CompilerTest ::= ExtClassName ["CmdLineArgs"] { FileTest [; FileTest]* }
#                    |  javac ["CmdLineArgs"] { FileTestNoFailure [; FileTestNoFailure]* }
#      FileTest     ::= Filenames [Description] [FailureSet]
#      FileTestNoFailure ::= Filenames [Description]
#      Filenames    ::= Filename [Filename]*
#      Description  ::= LitString
#      FailureSet   ::= Failure [, Failure]*
#      Failure      ::= ( ErrorKind )
#                    |  ( ErrorKind, "RegExp" )
#                    |  ( "RegExp" )
#                    |  ( )
#      ErrorKind    :   one of, or a unique prefix of one of the following

#                       "Lexical Error", "Syntax Error", "Semantic Error"
#                       or "Post-compiler Error".
#      Filename     :   the name of a file. Is interpreted from the 
#                       directory where pth is run.
#      LitString    :   a literal string, enclosed in quotes.
#      RegExp       :   a regular expression, as in java.util.regex; 
#                       is always enclosed in quotes.
#      CmdLineArgs  :   additional command line args for the Polyglot 
#                       compiler; is always enclosed in quotes.
