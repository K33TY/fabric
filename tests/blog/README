								
Summary
----------

The FabIL Blog webapp is meant to be an example of a FabIL webapp. It is a 
simple webapp that also has benchmarking tools. It is standalone so it can be
started without any extra programs. It has two components: the FabIL blog webapp
and another webapp called the worker written in Java which can stress test the 
blog server.

Installing
------------

Run ant

Using
------------

By default, the blog server stores objects on core0 with worker name worker0.
	1) Start core0
	2) Make a principal for worker0 (fab --name worker0 --make-principal core0)
	3) Run ant run-blog
	
This will start a blog server on port 8080 (http://localhost:8080/web)

To start a worker, just run ant run-worker. You can also run it from the 
command-line so that you can run multiple workers at different ports. The
default port is 9000 (http://localhost:9000/web).
