TODO Items:
	- Handle static methods
	- Evaluation
	- Remote calls?
		- Are we currently handling them correctly, probably depends on
		  whether we transform memoization before or after remote calls
		  are rewritten...  Although, wouldn't the resulting call be
		  more or less equivalent?
	- Avoiding unnecessary invalidation?
