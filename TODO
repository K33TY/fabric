* Are static non-final fields something we'll need to support?
* More extensive testing (compiler and runtime).
* Make default begin and end conflict labels some special label representing
  "no accesses are expected during this method" and support this behavior in
  the label checker.
* Array accesses
* Inserting staging checks before method calls (if needed)
* Syntax for writersToReaders?  Alternatively, change method begin and end
  conflict labels to be treated as converted to writersToReaders form by the
  compiler...
* Incorporate object splitting for more truth-y/safe locking behavior.
* Does the runtime system gracefully handle stage commands out-of-transaction?
