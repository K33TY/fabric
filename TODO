TODO Items:
	- Evaluation
	- Rigorous Testing
	- Design Decisions to revisit:
		- Remembering values read if call ends with a runtime
		  exception.
		- Not checking for updates on non-fabric objects.
		- Various uses of hashing feel fishy, am I setting myself up
		  for collisions hell?
	- Remote calls?
		- Are we currently handling them correctly, probably depends on
		  whether we transform memoization before or after remote calls
		  are rewritten...  Although, wouldn't the resulting call be
		  more or less equivalent?
		- Do we currently risk not invalidating calls on remote hosts?
	- Avoiding unnecessary invalidation?
	- Attempt to detect and warn about side effects?
