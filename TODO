* Are static non-final fields something we'll need to support?
* More extensive testing (compiler and runtime).
* Incorporate object splitting for more truth-y/safe locking behavior.
* Does the runtime system gracefully handle stage commands out-of-transaction?
* What's going on with labeled non-local breaks (we're allowing things to
  compile which shouldn't...)?
* Branching:
	* Procedure returns (return/exceptions), Conditional, and Ifs: working
	  but could be improved to avoid unneeded stage checks.
	* Do
	* Try
	* Switch
