OO7 Example Application
=======================

This is a simple implementation of the OO7 object-oriented database benchmark
on top of Fabric. It is written using FabIL.

To build:
  $ ant

Start the store that will be holding the OO7 databases:
  $ bin/start-store

  This will start a store named "database".

If you are starting with a fresh store, you will need to initialize the worker
by creating its principal object on the store:
  $ bin/init-worker

To create a OO7 database:
  $ bin/create-db fab://[store_name]/[db_name] [db_size] [fanout]

  e.g. small database named "OO7" with fanout=3:
    $ bin/create-db fab://database/OO7 small 3

To execute a traversal (e.g. T1 on the database named "OO7"):
  $ bin/t1 fab://database/OO7

  Similar scripts for running T2a, T2b, T2c, and T6 traversals are also
  available in the 'bin' directory.

To clean up the store's persistent state, remove the 'var' directory:
  $ rm -rf var
