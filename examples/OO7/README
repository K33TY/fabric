OO7 Example Application
=======================

This is a simple implementation of the OO7 object-oriented database
benchmark on top of Fabric. It is written using FabIL.

This directory contains the following sub-directories:

  - src/fabil: source code for the FabIL implementation of OO7
  - src/java: source code for the Java implementation of OO7
  - bin: a collection of scripts for running the example
  - etc: configuration files for the example's store and worker


Using
-----
This example comes with a store named "database" for storing the OO7
databases, and a worker named "worker" for creating OO7 databases and
running the OO7 traversals.

  0. Begin in the OO7 example directory and compile the example:

        $ cd $FABRIC/examples/OO7
        $ ant

  1. Start the "database" store that will be holding the OO7 database.
     The 'start-all' script will start the store in a separate xterm
     window:

        $ bin/start-all

     You can also use an xterm replacement (e.g., gnome-terminal or
     konsole):

        $ XTERM=gnome-terminal bin/start-all

     Or, if you prefer, you can start the store separately in your
     favourite terminal emulator:

	$ bin/start-store

  2. Create a OO7 database:

	$ bin/create-db

  3. Execute a traversal:

	$ bin/t1

     The script will execute a traversal and print out timing
     information. To execute a traversal against a "hot" worker cache,
     add the "--hot" option:

        $ bin/t1 --hot

     Similar scripts for running T2a, T2b, T2c, and T6 traversals are
     also available in the 'bin' directory.

  4. Exit the store with the "exit" command in its console (you can also
     use CTRL-D).

     You can clean up the store's persistent state by removing the 'var'
     directory:

	$ rm -rf var
