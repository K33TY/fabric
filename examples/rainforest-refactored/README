Rainforest
==========

This program emulates two competing shoppers, Alice and Bob,
attempting to hoard a store's entire inventory, one item at a time.

  - Rainforest is a marketplace that runs a storage node,
    "rainforest", representing its central database. It also has two
    workers, "aliceOutlet" and "bobOutlet", representing outlets that
    are located close to Alice and Bob, respectively.

  - Outel is a vendor in the marketplace. It runs a storage node that
    tracks the inventory of the product it sells.

  - Countribank is a bank, at which Alice, Bob, and Outel all hold
    accounts. It runs a storage node that holds the account balances.

This directory contains the following sub-directories:

  - src: source code for the example, written in Fabric
  - bin: a collection of scripts for running the example
  - etc: configuration files for the example's stores and workers


Using
-----

  0. Begin in the rainforest example directory and compile the
     example:

        $ cd $FABRIC/examples/rainforest
        $ ant

  I. Start the nodes and, if necessary, initialize their state:
  
    1. The 'start-all' script will start each node in a separate xterm
       window:

          $ bin/start-all

       You can also use an xterm replacement (e.g., gnome-terminal or
       konsole):

          $ XTERM=gnome-terminal bin/start-all

       Or, if you prefer, you can start the nodes separately in your
       favourite terminal emulator:

          $ bin/start-store rainforest
          $ bin/start-store countribank
          $ bin/start-store outel
          $ bin/start-worker aliceOutlet
          $ bin/start-worker bobOutlet

    2. If you are starting from fresh stores, you will need to
       initialize the application state. Otherwise, skip to II below.

          $ bin/init

  II. Start the application:

        $ bin/run

  III.  Exit the nodes with the "exit" command in each console (you
        can also use CTRL-D).

        While the nodes are shut down, you can clean up the stores'
        persistent state by removing 'var' from the rainforest example
        directory:

        $ rm -rf var
