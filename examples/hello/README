Hello World
===========

This is a Fabric port of every programmer's favorite program. It stores the
string "Hello World" persistently, and then prints it out.

This directory contains the following sub-directories:

  - src: source code for the example, written in Fabric
  - bin: a collection of scripts for running the example
  - etc: configuration files for the example's store and worker


Using
-----
This example comes with a store named "store" for storing persistent data,
and a worker named "worker" to run the computation.

  0. Begin in the hello example directory and compile the example:

        $ cd $FABRIC/examples/hello
        $ ant

  1. Start the store:

        $ bin/start-store

  2. Run the program:

        $ bin/say-hello

  3. You can clean up the store's persistent state by removing the 'var'
     directory:

        $ rm -rf var
