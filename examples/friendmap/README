Social Mashup Example
=====================

This is the FriendMap example program. It enables Alice, a user of a
social network, to use a mapping service to create a map that displays
the location of one of her friends, Bob, while maintaining his location
privacy.

This directory contains the following sub-directories:

  - src: source code for the FriendMap example
  - bin: a collection of scripts for running the example
  - etc: configuration files for the example's Fabric nodes


Using
-----
This example uses five stores ("friendmap", "mapserv", "snapp", "alice",
and "bob").

  0. Start in the FriendMap example directory and build the principal
     utilities:

        $ cd $FABRIC/examples/friendmap
        $ ant

  1. Start up instances of the five stores. The 'start-all' script will
     start each store in a separate xterm window:

        $ bin/start-all

     You can also use an xterm replacement (e.g., gnome-terminal or
     konsole):

        $ XTERM=gnome-terminal bin/start-all

     Or, if you prefer, you can start each store individually in your
     favourite terminal emulator:

        $ bin/start-store snapp
        $ bin/start-store mapserv
        $ bin/start-store friendmap
        $ bin/start-store alice
        $ bin/start-store bob

  2. If you are starting from fresh stores, you will need to initialize
     the application state by following the next step. Otherwise, skip
     to step 3 below.

     Run the 'initialize' script to initialize the stores' state. This
     will publish the example's code to the stores and initialize the
     application's state.

        $ bin/initialize

  3. The 'friendmap' script will run the example. You should see in
     alice's console a 10x10 map showing Bob's location.

        $ bin/friendmap

  4. Exit the stores with the "exit" command in each console (you can
     also use CTRL-D).

     You can clean up the stores' persistent state by removing 'var'
     from the FriendMap example directory:

        $ rm -rf var
