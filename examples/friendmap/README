This is the FriendMap example program.  It is intended to model a social
network.

This directory contains the following sub-directories:

  - src: source code for the FriendMap example
  - bin: a collection of scripts for running the example
  - etc: configuration files for the example's Fabric nodes


Using
-----
This example uses five stores ("friendmap", "mapserv", "snapp", "alice", and
"bob").

  0. Start in the FriendMap example directory. Build the principal utilities:

      $ cd $FABRIC/examples/friendmap
      $ ant build-util

  1. Start up instances of the five stores. The 'start-all' script will start
     each store in a separate xterm window:

      $ bin/start-all

     You can also use an xterm replacement (e.g., gnome-terminal or konsole):

      $ XTERM=gnome-terminal bin/start-all

     Or, if you prefer, you can start each store individually in your favourite
     terminal emulator:

      $ bin/start-store snapp
      $ bin/start-store mapserv
      $ bin/start-store friendmap
      $ bin/start-store alice
      $ bin/start-store bob

     If you are starting from fresh stores, you will need to initialize the
     application state by following the next step.  Otherwise, skip to step 3
     below.

  2. Run the 'initialize' script to initialize the stores' state.  This will
     publish the example's code to the stores, and initialize the application's
     state.

      $ bin/initialize

  3. The 'friendmap' script will run the example.  You should in alice's
     console a 10x10 map showing Bob's location.

      $ bin/friendmap

  4. You can clean up the stores' persistent state by removing 'var' from the
     FriendMap example directory:

      $ rm -rf var
