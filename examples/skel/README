This is a template for creating fabric examples.  Many of our examples have
multiple versions - maybe the example is modeled in java and then ported to
fabil, or modeled in jif and ported to fabric, and this directory layout and
build file are designed for this scenario.

To create an example, copy this directory and perform the following steps:

1. Write your source code in the appropriate src/ subdirectory
2. Update the build file, replacing "skel" with the name of your example
3. Create etc/keys/node and etc/config/node for any fabric nodes required to
   run your example
4. Create shell scripts in bin/ to run your example
5. Replace this README with documentation for your example
