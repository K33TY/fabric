Scribble is an example of an applet whose class and instances are stored in
fabric.  Scribble.html uses FabricAppletPanel to load the applet class and
instantiate a new Scribble object on store0.  Scribble2.html loads the instance 
from fabric. Currently, Scribble2.html must be loaded in a different browser
(i.e. Firefox and Safari) or on a different system since the applets share a VM
and therefore a worker.

0.1. Run 'ant jar' to build the applet jar and create signed jars of the fabric
libraries.

0.2. Start and initialize some stores: 
	fab-store --store store0
	fab --name worker0 --make-principal store0 

	fab-store --store database
	fab --name worker --make-principal database

1. Compile Scribble.fil
	filc -dumpdeps Scribble.fil

2. Push Scribble classes to store0.
codebasetool export worker0 . store0 Scribble
(note OID of Scribble class)

3. Edit classOid parameter in Scribble.html if necessary.

4. Browse to Scribble.html
(note OID of Scribble instance in Java Console).

5. Edit objectOid parameter in Scribble2.html if necessary.

6. Browse to Scribble2.html from another browser.
	note that changes to the scribble canvas are shared between browsers, but
	only on repaint.
