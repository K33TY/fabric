Scribble is an example of an applet whose class and instances are stored in
fabric.  Scribble.html uses FabricAppletPanel to load the applet class and
instantiate a new Scribble object.  Scribble2.html loads a Scribble object from
fabric.  


0.1. Start and initialize store with worker0's principal: 
fab-store --store store0
fab --name worker0 --make-principal store0 
(note principal OID for config)

0.2. Jars in applet/examples/lib/ must be signed.

1. Compile Scribble.fil
	cd applet/examples/Scribble
	filc -dumpdeps Scribble.fil

2. Push Scribble classes to store0.
codebasetool export worker0 . store0 Scribble
(note OID of Scribble class)

3. Edit classOid parameter in Scribble.html if necessary.

4. Browse to Scribble.html
(note OID of Scribble instance in Java Console).

5. Edit objectOid parameter in Scribble2.html if necessary.

6. Browse to Scribble2.html

KNOWN ISSUES: Loading the instance in Scribble2.html causes the 
Scribble.html applet to stop repainting/responding? Why?
