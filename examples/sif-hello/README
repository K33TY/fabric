Sif Example Application
=======================

This is a simple web service example, built using Fabric and the Fabric port of
the SIF servlet library.  This webapp is standalone, so it can be started
without any extra programs.

This directory contains the following sub-directories:

  - src: source code for the sif example, written in Fabric
  - bin: a collection of scripts for running the example
  - etc: configuration files for the example's store and worker
  - web: web server configuration information


Compiling
---------
To build the example, run 'ant' in the OO7 example directory:

  $ ant


Using
-----
This example comes with a store named "backend" for storing persistent data,
and a worker named "webserver" that provides the web-based user interface.

  0. Begin in the sif-hello example directory:

        $ cd $FABRIC/examples/sif-hello

  1. Start the "backend" store:

        $ bin/start-store

  2. If you are starting with a fresh store, you will need to initialize the
     worker by creating its principal object on the store:

        $ bin/init-worker

  3. Start the web-server:

        $ bin/start-webapp

  4. Point your favorite web browser to http://localhost:8080/hello

  5. You can clean up the store's persistent state by removing the 'var'
     directory:

        $ rm -rf var
