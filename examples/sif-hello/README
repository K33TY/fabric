Hello World Webapp Example
==========================

This is a simple web service example, built using Fabric and the
Fabric port of the Servlets with Information Flow (SIF) library [1].
This webapp is standalone, so it can be started without any extra
programs.

This directory contains the following sub-directories:

  - src: source code for the example, written in Fabric
  - bin: a collection of scripts for running the example
  - etc: configuration files for the example's store and worker
  - web: web server configuration information


Using
-----
This example comes with a store named "backend" for storing
persistent data, and a worker named "webserver" that provides the
web-based user interface.

  0. Begin in the sif-hello example directory and compile the example:

        $ cd $FABRIC/examples/sif-hello
        $ ant

  1. Start the "backend" store:

        $ bin/start-store

  2. Start the web server:

        $ bin/start-webapp

  3. Point your favorite web browser to http://localhost:8080/hello

  4. You can clean up the store's persistent state by removing the
     'var' directory:

        $ rm -rf var
