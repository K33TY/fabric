Image App example for Mobile Fabric paper. 

We have a smartphone device with a camera, that allows its user take
take images. By default images are private, but the user can mark
certain images as shared. Shared images have bitmap component of them
set to public.

As for the third-party app, I have programmed the action that
simulates "the first run of the app". During this run, the app
accesses all images stored on the device, generates thumbnails for
*all images*, and displays the thumbnails to the user. The app also
publishes (currently implemented by printing to {}) the images that
are marked as shared.

We can easily add a small an extra feature in which together with the
thumbnails, the app displays to the user whether the image has been
taken "close to home", for a given a of private coordinates
corresponding to the user home, stored on the device. No
declassifications currently happen in the image app, but there are
some auto-endorsements needed in the camera implementation.
