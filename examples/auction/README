This is the auction example program.  It is intended to model a complex auction
in which sellers submit confidential sales strategies, and a buyer submits a
confidential purchasing strategy.  Each seller may make an offer based on the
buyer, and the buyer may then choose among these options.  At the end of the
auction, the identity of the winner is revealed to all participants.
