Bidding Agent Mobile Code Example
=================================

This is the auction example program.  It is intended to model a complex auction
in which sellers submit confidential sales strategies, and a buyer submits a
confidential purchasing strategy.  Each seller may make an offer based on the
buyer, and the buyer may then choose among these options.  At the end of the
auction, the identity of the winner is revealed to all participants.

This directory contains the following sub-directories:

  - src: source code for the auction example
  - bin: a collection of scripts for running the example
  - etc: configuration files for the example's Fabric nodes


Using
-----
This example uses four stores ("brokerStore", "airlineAStore", "airlineBStore",
and "userStore").

  0. Start in the auction example directory and build the initialization code
     for setting up the principal hierarchy:

      $ cd $FABRIC/examples/auction
      $ ant

  1. Start up instances of the broker, airline, and user stores. The
     'start-all' script will start each store in a separate xterm window:

      $ bin/start-all

     You can also use an xterm replacement (e.g., gnome-terminal or konsole):

      $ XTERM=gnome-terminal bin/start-all

     Or, if you prefer, you can start each store individually in your favourite
     terminal emulator:

      $ bin/start-store brokerStore
      $ bin/start-store airlineAStore
      $ bin/start-store airlineBStore
      $ bin/start-store userStore

  2. If you are starting from fresh stores, you will need to initialize the
     application state.  Otherwise, skip to step 3 below.

     Run the 'initialize' script to initialize the stores' state.  This will
     initialize the principal hierarchy, publish the example's code to the
     stores, and initialize the application's state.

      $ bin/initialize

  3. The 'auction' script will run the example.  You should see output in the
     broker store's console, indicating that Airline B has won the auction.

      $ bin/auction

  4. You can clean up the stores' persistent state by removing 'var' from the
     auction example directory:

      $ rm -rf var
