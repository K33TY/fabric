authdb Example
==============

This is a simple authentication database built using Fabric,
with a shim for calling into the database from Java.

This directory contains the following sub-directories:

  - src: source code for the example
  - bin: a collection of scripts for running the example
  - etc: configuration files for the example's store and worker


Using
-----
This example comes with a store named "store" for storing persistent
data, and a worker named "worker" for running a test program.

  0. Begin in the authdb directory and compile this example:

        $ cd authdb
        $ ant

  1. Start the store. The 'start-all' script will start the
     store in a separate xterm window:

        $ bin/start-all

     You can also use an xterm replacement (e.g., gnome-terminal or
     konsole):

        $ XTERM=gnome-terminal bin/start-all

     Or, if you prefer, you can start the store separately in your
     favourite terminal emulator:

        $ bin/start-store

  2. Start the test program:

        $ bin/run-test

  3. Exit the store with the "exit" command in its console (you can also
     use CTRL-D).

     You can clean up the store's persistent state by removing the 'var'
     directory:

        $ rm -rf var
