This is a very simple web application example.

====Compiling the Sif-hello Example====

Running 'ant examples' in the Fabric base directory will compile all examples
including the sif-hello example.

If only this sif-hello example needs to be compiled, first run 'ant libs' in the
Fabric base directory to make sure all library code is compiled. Then run 'ant'
in the $FABRIC/exampes/sif-hello directory to compile the this example.

====Running the Sif-hello Example====

The sif-hello example runs on one store (store0) and one worker (worker0)
The store does not have any persistent application data.

Follow these steps to start this web application, and check it in your browser:

Step 1. Start a fresh instance of the store0

The following items should be on the classpath:

a. $FABRIC/examples/sif-hello/classes
b. $FABRIC/src/lib/transient/classes
c. $FABRIC/classes
d. $FABRIC/rt-classes
e. $FABRIC/src/lib/sif/classes

Running the following command will start a new store for this application:
$ fab-store --store store0

Step 2. Create principals for worker0

Run the following command to do this:

$ fab --name worker0 --make-principal store0

Step 3. 
Make sure $FABRIC/examples/travel/classes is on your classpath, and
Run the following command in any terminal:

$ fab-http --name worker0 $FABRIC/examples/sif-hello/web --port 8080

Step 4.
Check the application at: http://localhost:8080/hello
